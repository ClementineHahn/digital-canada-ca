		<div class="section-quote">“Digital technologies represent the best opportunities for better services to Canadians. Getting ‘digital’ right means that we get ‘government’ right.”
			<div class="quote-author">&mdash; The Honourable Scott Brison, President of the Treasury Board</div>
		</div>

		<p>At the Government of Canada, we serve 36 million people – not to mention those around the world who are moving, visiting, and doing business here. From immigration to health, from taxes to veterans’ benefits, these people expect and deserve services that are easy to use, and centred on their needs. There has never been a better time to affect the lives and work of all of these people.</p>

		<p>We are looking for a visionary and inspiring leader with a proven track record to take the delivery of Canadian services to the next level. You will be working with and growing a small and committed team. You will benefit from engaged and proactive support from the Minister and top Public Service executives. You will work alongside experienced colleagues from across government and with outside partners. This is a unique opportunity to lead change for a country. You will make a difference.</p>

				<p>As Chief Executive, you will lead – and continue to build – the recently established Canadian Digital Service (CDS). CDS is an agile and small but mighty team that partners with government departments to improve services, rethinking service design and delivery from the user’s perspective, and engaging users every step of the way. You will also be charged with building community and growing digital capacity across the federal government – and providing advice and guidance that is grounded in your experience and an understanding of what works.</p>

				<p>This role reports to the Secretary of the Treasury Board and is a senior executive position. The Treasury Board Secretariat, one of three central agencies of the federal government, wields considerable influence as the standard-setter for the rest of the Public Service and is home to the federal open government team, the federal CIO, and the government’s Service Strategy.</p>
