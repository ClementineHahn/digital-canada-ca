		<h2 class="section--title">Interested in joining CDS?</h2>

		<p>Our mission is to build government services that are simple and easy to use. We work with federal departments to focus on users: the millions of Canadians and people around the world who use government services every day. We deploy small, interdisciplinary teams of developers, designers and UX researchers, data scientists, and product managers to work with departments, using agile methods to prototype, build, and deploy digital service solutions. We are building a team of talented, passionate, and driven people who will help make it happen. If you are ready to work on some of Canada’s <a href="/2017/08/24/picking-our-projects/">biggest service delivery opportunities</a>, like improving services for immigrants and veterans, join us for the opportunity to make a real impact for your country.</p>

		<p>We're also looking for a CEO for the Canadian Digital Service! We're currently recruiting an experienced and inspiring Chief Executive to lead the CDS team, in executing a bold agenda with a lasting impact. Find out <a href="/talent/ceo/">more about the role and how to apply</a>.</p>
